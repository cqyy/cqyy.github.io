Most People Won't

-----------
<p></p>
Most people want to be fit, most people aren’t.

<p></p>
Most people want to build a successful business, most people won’t.

<p></p>
Most people want to be the best version of themselves, most people aren’t.

<p></p>
Most people have dreams they want to fulfill, most people won’t.

<p></p>
Everyone wants to quit something, build something, be something, do something. Most people won’t.

<p></p>
How many things have we wanted?

<p></p> 
How many opportunities have we craved?

<p></p>
How many broken things have we wanted to fix? 

<p></p>
And how many of those have we shrunk from. Hid from. Or, excused away.

<p></p>
We’re not alone.

<p></p>
Most people won’t.

<p></p>
But every once in a while someone puts themselves out there. 

<p></p>
Makes the leap. Faces rejection or failure or worse. 

<p></p>
And comes out the other side.

<p></p>
Better. Changed. Bolder.

<p></p> 
Most people won’t. 

<p></p>
Which means those that do change everything.
